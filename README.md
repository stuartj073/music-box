## UX/UI

### Scope
From the outset of this project, I drafted up possible features to be included. These were then compared against eachother in terms of overall practicality for every potential visitor to the site.


#### Current Features

The following features were included within the site:

- Home page (with links to every part of the site)
- Products page 
- Interactive features
- Search bar
- Review feature
- Blog feature 
- All CRUD operations
- Log in page
- Register page
- Profile page
- Add product feature
- Back to top button
- Social links
- About section
- Shopping basket (available on every page - bar profile)

#### Features left to implement

- Direct messaging feature. Which allows user's to contact eachother regarding blog posts or products.
- Shop coupons. Eventually, I would like to incorporate a shop 'coupons' feature that rewards active members and those that are making quite a lot of purchase orders. With the project only in it's inception I would prefer to leave this feature to a later time.
