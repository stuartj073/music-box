## Deployment 

The deployment of the website was done so using three different work spaces, each with their own respective steps. Github, MongoDB and heroku combined all their necessary functions to enable the creation of the site. 

### Github

- Creation
I first created the repositary through logging into my Github account and:
- Clicking the 'new' green button.
- This then prompted me to another page with asked me to name my new repositary. Above this input there is a dropdown menu offering a selection of various templates to utilise with the repository. I chose the Code Institute template in order to faciliate all the shortcuts included within it to make my workflow as fast as possible.

- Cloning and Forking
In order to clone my repository, the user must visit my repository page.
- Cloning by command line: Click the button beside the green button titled 'code', there you will be given various options on how you would like to clone the repository. You must then type 'git clone' into your own workspace along with the repo URL and enter.
- Forking: Go to my repositary [page](https://github.com/stuartj073/rate-my-record). In the top right of the page, below the navbar, click the 'fork' button. The fork should now be in your repositories.

### MongoDB


#### Github configuration

- Create an env.py file with the following connections. ENSURE THIS FILE IS ADDED TO THE .GITIGNORE FILE.
- To install any requirements as needed, use the terminal and prefix any requirement with 'pip3'.


### Heroku 

- Once logged in to Heroku click 'New' and then 'Create New app'. Click 'settings' and 'reveal config vars'. 
- Here you must put in all the key-value pairs as written down from the env.py file. Update any missing values with the new information you now have. 
- Now click 'Deploy'. 
- You are given three options in which to deploy the site. In my case I used Github, which allows you to manually search for your own Github repository. 
- Click 'enable automatic deployment' and your website should now be ready to go.
